                <h1>dislikes</h1>
                <p>i dont like software that costs a lot of money. i also dont like software crashing and losing my work. another thing i dont like is when people dont understand the value of my work, and also sometimes theirs. sometimes i talk to people and they think that their hours of work are worth below minimum wage, which is really upsetting for me. when talking to clients, it makes me disappointed to hear that they think work like mine isnt worth as much as i say.</p>
